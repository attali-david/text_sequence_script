Echoes of Time

In the quiet, quiet night,
Stars shine bright, oh so bright.
Whispers soft, whispers light,
In the night, night, night.

Dreams take flight, flight, flight,
In the quiet, quiet night.
Hearts beat soft, beat soft, so right,
In the night, night, night.

Love's embrace, embrace so tight,
In the quiet, quiet night.
Echoes linger, linger bright,
In the night, night, night.

Time moves on, on, on in sight,
In the quiet, quiet night.
Memories stay, stay in light,
In the night, night, night.
